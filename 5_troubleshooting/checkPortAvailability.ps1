#This script was built for testing port connectivity and availability during the preliminary stages of a deployment when you may not have yet installed the Esri applications that would be listening on their specific ports, but you still need to determine if the ports are open or if they're being blocked by a firewall.
#The script first translates an fqdn to its IP address so it can be used by nmap, and also as a test of resolvability
#The script then checks to see if nmap is installed, and if not, downloads and installs it.
#The script then has nmap run a scan for the specified fqdn's IP and port, and returns the resulting state and the nmap-defined interpretation of that state to the console
#A state value of "CLOSED" is common or expected if this script is run against one of the ArcGIS Enterprise component ports before the software is installed.
#A state value of "FILTERED" is more telling and suggests that there may be a firewall or other filter blocking the traffic

#Change the $targetFQDN and $targetPort values before running
